**Clean PNG Files** - Remove Interfering PNG Chunks

## Why It's Needed

* PNG files sometimes include optional _data chunks_ that can interfere with use in _Video Blender_ or video editing software
    * _Examples:_
    * Display color calibration data
    * Display aspect ratio data
* When using PNG from different workflows, non-matching frames can cause confusion
    * Frames to appear not to match when using _Frame Chooser_
    * Frames have different shapes when using sofware such as _Premiere Pro_
* PNG files are rewritten including only the essential RGB color data

## How It Works
1. Choose _Individual Path_ or _Batch Processing_
    - If **Individual Path**
        - Set _Input Path_ to a path on this server to the PNG files being cleaned
    - If **Batch Processing**
        - Set _Input Path_ to a directory on this server containing PNG frame groups to be cleaned
1. Click _Clean_ or _Clean Batch_
1. Each PNG file will be rewritten excluding optional data
    - üéÅ As a bonus, the PNG files usually have a smaller file size!

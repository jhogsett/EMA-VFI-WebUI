**Video Remixer Set Up** - Confirm Project Settings and Choose Thumbnail Type

The _Project Details_ box shows a summary of the remix project about to be created.

## How To Use
1. Choose a _Thumbnail Type_:
    - **_GIF_**
        - A 10X sped-up animated GIF of the entire scene
        - GIF thumbnails provide the best experience, but are _slow to render_
        - They are best used when selecting certain key clips from a video
    - **_JPG_**
        - A still image at the center of the scene
        - JPG thumbnails are _fast to render_ but may not provide enough confidence for _keep_ vs. _drop_ decisions
        - They are best used with the _Break_ split type to identify and remove commercial scenes
1. Click _Set Up Project_ to begin the setup process
- Progress can be tracked in the console

## Important
- This process could be slow, perhaps many hours long!
- `ffmpeg.exe` must be available on the system path

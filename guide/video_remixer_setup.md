**Video Remixer Set Up** - Confirm Project Settings and Choose Thumbnail Type

The _Project Details_ box shows a summary of the remix project about to be created.

## How To Use
1. Choose a _Thumbnail Type_:
    - **_GIF_**
        - A 10X sped-up animated GIF of the entire scene
        - GIF thumbnails provide the best experience as they show the whole scene
        - They take a bit more time to render than _JPG_ thumbnails
    - **_JPG_**
        - A still image from the middle moment of the scene
        - JPG thumbnails are _fast to render_ but may obscure some scene details
        - They are best used with the _Break_ split type to identify and remove commercial scenes
1. Click _Set Up Project_ to begin the setup process
- Progress can be tracked in the console

## Important
- This process could be slow, perhaps many hours long!
- The browser window does NOT need to be left open
    - The project can be reopened later to resume where you left off
- `ffmpeg.exe` must be available on the system path

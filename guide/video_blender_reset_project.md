**Video Blender New Project** - Reset a Video Blender project

## How To Use

1. Choose an existing project
1. Click _Reset Project_

## Note
- This process uses the _New Project_ tab to selectively recreate parts of a _Video Blender_ project
- **The default use case is:** wipe out any edits made to the _working frames_ set and restore them from _source frames_

## Important
- The `edits.csv` file is not deleted by _Reset Project_
- The zeroth frame files are not deleted from _source frames_ and _working frames_ when _Reset Project_ is used

**GIF to PNG Sequence** - Use FFMpeg to convert a GIF to set of PNG frame files

## How It Works
1. Set _GIF File_ to the path and filename of a GIF file on this server for conversion
1. Set _PNG Files Path_ to a path on this server for the converted PNG files
1. Click _Convert_
1. `ffmpeg.exe` is used to perform the conversion
1. The _Details_ box shows the `ffmpeg.exe` command line used

## Important
- `ffmpeg.exe` must be available on the system path
